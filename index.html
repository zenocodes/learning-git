            <h1>Learning Git and GitHub</h1>
            <p>Git is installed locally in my computer. It tracks changes made in a file.</p>
            <p>GitHub is a remote storage. I can store my codes there and access them anywhere as long as I have internet connection. It is similar to BitBucket</p>
